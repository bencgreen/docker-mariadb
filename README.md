[Docker Repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/bcgdesign/mariadb) - [bcg|design ecosystem](https://github.com/bencgreen/docker)

I've been using [webhippie](https://github.com/dockhippie/mariadb)'s MariaDB image for a while, but I wanted to manage backups in a different way, and use the latest version of [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/).

So this was originally a fork of that, with a different backup script to store backups by date rather than index.  However it is now substantially different, using my own [Alpine](https://hub.docker.com/r/bcgdesign/alpine-s6) base image, with a clean install of the [S6 Overlay](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay).

## Backups

Backups are stored:

* in the `/var/lib/backup` volume
* in subfolders by date and time (yyMMddhhmm)
* every eight hours

The following environment variables are available for the backups:

```bash
BACKUP_COMPRESS_FILES = 0 # Set to '1' to gzip the SQL backup files
BACKUP_KEEP_FOR_DAYS = 14 # Backups will be kept for this many days
```

## Ports

* 3306

## Volumes

* `/etc/mysql/conf.d` - optional additional configuration
* `/var/lib/mysql` - data files
* `/var/lib/backup` - backup files
