# Docker MariaDB

![build](https://github.com/bencgreen/docker-mariadb/workflows/build/badge.svg)

I've been using [webhippie](https://github.com/dockhippie/mariadb)'s MariaDB image for a while, but I wanted to manage backups in a different way, and use the latest version of [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/).

So this is a fork of that, with a different backup script to store backups by date rather than index.  Backups are stored:

* in the `/var/lib/backup` volume
* in subfolders by date and time (yyMMddhhmm)
* every eight hours

The following environment variables are available for the backups:

```bash
BACKUP_COMPRESS_FILES = 0 # Set to '1' to gzip the SQL backup files
BACKUP_KEEP_FOR_DAYS = 14 # Backups will be kept for this many days
```

## Volumes

* /etc/mysql/conf.d
* /var/lib/mysql
* /var/lib/backup

## Ports

* 3306
